# Welcome👋  

My name is Guilherme Drezza  

I go by my middle name, Nick  

I'm a software developer  

[Check out my website, you can find my projects here](https://guidrezza.com)  

At work, I build AI agents, RAG systems, automations, and internal dev/data tools  

In my free time, I like to build [open-source projects of all kinds](https://guidrezza.com)

## 🚀 Projects & Systems  
- **Company RAG assistant:** Pioneered the org’s first **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** system with an intern I mentored  
  - Fast RAG across internal knowledge (training material, SOPs, org goals, and more)  
  - **Team personalization** + **role-based access controls**  
  - Supports onboarding, training, and daily cross-team Q&A  
  - Stack: Embeddings + vector search, prompt guardrails, analytics & feedback loops  
- **LLM agents for ops:** Sales/editorial prep helpers orchestrated with **n8n** + OpenAI, grounded on **Snowflake** and **Google Docs/Sheets** company data  
- **Automation & reliability:** EC2 “automation box” hardened with **CloudWatch** logs/alarms; fewer failures + happier cron jobs  
- **Event pipelines @ scale:** Refactors to avoid Sheets rate limits and speed up Swoogo registration uploads

## 🧰 Tech I reach for
- **Languages:** Python, TypeScript/Node, SQL, PHP  
- **Cloud/Data:** AWS (EC2, CloudWatch, S3), Snowflake, HubSpot, relational & vector databases
- **Web engineering:** WordPress VIP development, Next.js projects, REST/GraphQL integrations  
- **LLMs:** OpenAI API, RAG systems, multi-agent workflows, prompt engineering, evals & guardrails
- **Security & Safety:** Access control, data protection, reliability, observability
