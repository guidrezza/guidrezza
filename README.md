## 🚀 Projects & Systems  
- **Company RAG assistant:** Pioneered the org’s first **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** system with an intern I mentored  
  - Fast RAG across internal knowledge (training material, SOPs, org goals, and more)  
  - **Team personalization** + **role-based access controls**  
  - Supports onboarding, training, and daily cross-team Q&A  
  - Stack: Embeddings + vector search, prompt guardrails, analytics & feedback loops  
- **LLM agents for ops:** Sales/editorial prep helpers orchestrated with **n8n** + OpenAI, grounded on **Snowflake** and **Google Docs/Sheets** company data  
- **Automation & reliability:** EC2 “automation box” hardened with **CloudWatch** logs/alarms; fewer failures + happier cron jobs  
- **Event pipelines @ scale:** Refactors to avoid Sheets rate limits and speed up Swoogo registration uploads
