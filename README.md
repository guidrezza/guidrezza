## 🚀 What I’m building
- **Company RAG assistant** *(pioneered with an intern I hired)* — our org’s first **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** system  
  - Fast RAG over large internal knowledge (training material, team SOPs, org goals, and more)  
  - **Personalization by team** + **access controls** for security  
  - Used for onboarding/training and everyday cross-team assistance  
  - Stack: embeddings + vector search, guarded prompts, usage analytics, and feedback loops  
- **LLM agents for ops** — sales/editorial prep helpers orchestrated with **n8n** + OpenAI, grounded on **Snowflake** and **Google Docs/Sheets** company data  
- **Automation & reliability** — EC2 “automation box” hardened with **CloudWatch** logs/alarms; fewer failures + happier cron jobs  
- **Event pipelines @ scale** — refactors to avoid Sheets rate limits and speed up Swoogo registration uploads

## 😎 Right now
- shipping practical AI (RAG/agents) that coworkers actually use  
- smoothing gnarly workflows → reliable, observable systems  
- tinkering with open-source and tiny utilities
